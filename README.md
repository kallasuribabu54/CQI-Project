# ☕ Coffee Quality Analysis Dashboard – Power BI

# 📊 Project Overview

This project explores the key determinants of coffee quality using a dataset containing detailed sensory evaluation attributes.
The goal was to uncover insights into how factors such as aroma, flavor, acidity, body, and balance influence the overall cup score (Total Cup Points) of coffee samples collected globally.


# 🎯 Business Problem

Coffee producers, traders, and quality graders often rely on sensory evaluation to assess coffee quality. However, understanding which attributes most strongly influence quality scores can help them:

Identify improvement areas in processing or cultivation.

Standardize quality grading.

Support data-driven decisions for premium pricing and exports.


# 🚀 Project Goals

Analyze relationships between sensory attributes (aroma, flavor, acidity, etc.) and overall coffee quality.

Identify top factors contributing to high-quality scores.

Visualize regional and processing method trends in coffee grading.

# 🧩 Dataset Details

The dataset contains coffee quality evaluation results with fields such as:

Country of Origin

Region

Altitude

Processing Method

Harvest Year

Variety

Sensory Attributes: Aroma, Flavor, Acidity, Body, Balance, Uniformity, Clean Cup, Sweetness, Aftertaste

Total Cup Points


Data was cleaned and prepared in Excel, then imported into Power BI for analysis.


# ⚙ Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removed null or duplicate records.

Standardized text (region names, country names).

Converted altitude ranges (1700–1900 or 1500~2000) into average values.

Extracted starting year from harvest year column (e.g., 2021/2022 → 2021).

Translated non-English region names into English.

Ensured consistent numeric data types for sensory attributes.

# 📈 Power BI Dashboard Highlights

Key Visuals:

1. Correlation Matrix – To identify the strongest relationships between sensory attributes and Total Cup Points.


2. Scatter Charts – Visual comparison between each sensory score and overall quality.


3. Decomposition Tree – Interactive breakdown of how each sensory factor impacts cup score.


4. Bar Charts & KPIs – Average scores by region, processing method, and variety.


5. Slicers – For exploring insights by country, processing method, and harvest year.



Key Insights:

Aroma, Flavor, and Balance are the top predictors of coffee quality.

Washed processing methods generally result in higher Total Cup Points.

Higher altitudes tend to produce better cup scores.

Some regions consistently maintain higher uniformity and sweetness scores.

# 🧠 Business Impact

This analysis provides actionable insights for:

Producers – Focus on improving key sensory attributes that drive high-quality scores.

Traders – Better evaluate and price coffee lots based on data-driven quality indicators.

Analysts – Build predictive models for coffee quality forecasting.

# 🛠 Tools Used
