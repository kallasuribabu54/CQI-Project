# 📊 Project Overview

This project explores the key determinants of coffee quality using a dataset containing detailed sensory evaluation attributes.
The goal was to uncover insights into how factors such as aroma, flavor, acidity, body, and balance influence the overall cup score (Total Cup Points) of coffee samples collected globally.


# 🎯 Business Problem

Coffee producers, traders, and quality graders often rely on sensory evaluation to assess coffee quality. However, understanding which attributes most strongly influence quality scores can help them:

Identify improvement areas in processing.

Standardize quality grading.

Support data-driven decisions for premium pricing and exports.


# 🚀 Project Goals

Analyze relationships between sensory attributes (aroma, flavor, acidity, etc.) and overall coffee quality.

Identify top factors contributing to high-quality scores.

Visualize regional and processing method trends in coffee grading.

# 🧩 Dataset Details

The dataset contains coffee quality evaluation results with fields such as:

Country of Origin, Region, Altitude,Processing Method, Harvest Year, Sensory Attributes: (Aroma, Flavor, Acidity, Body, Balance, Uniformity, Clean Cup, Sweetness, Aftertaste),Total Cup Points

Data was cleaned and prepared in Excel, then imported into Power BI for analysis.

# ⚙ Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removed null or duplicate records.

Standardized text (region names, country names).

Converted altitude ranges (1700–1900 or 1500~2000) into average values.

Extracted starting year from harvest year column (e.g., 2021/2022 → 2021).

Translated non-English region names into English.

Ensured consistent numeric data types for sensory attributes.

# 📈 Power BI Dashboard Highlights

Key Visuals:

1. Scatter Charts – Visual comparison between each sensory score and overall quality.

2. Decomposition Tree – Interactive breakdown of how each sensory factor impacts cup score.

3. Bar Charts – scores by region, processing method, and variety.

4. Slicers – For exploring insights by country, processing method, and harvest year.

5. Scatter Charts - Too See the impact of the defects on the overall coffee quality.

Key Insights:

Aroma, Flavor are the top predictors of coffee quality.

Washed(Wet) processing methods generally result in higher Total Cup Points.

Higher altitudes tend to produce better cup scores.

Some regions consistently maintain higher uniformity and sweetness scores.

# 🧠 Business Impact

This analysis provides actionable insights for:

Producers – Focus on improving key sensory attributes that drive high-quality scores.

Traders – Better evaluate and price coffee lots based on data-driven quality indicators.

Analysts – Build predictive models for coffee quality forecasting.

# 🛠 Tools Used

Excel – Data cleaning and transformation

Power BI – Visualization and dashboard creation

GitHub – Project documentation and version control

# 🌍 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analytics can bring clarity and value to agricultural quality assessment.
By visualizing sensory attributes and their influence on total quality, stakeholders can make more informed and consistent coffee grading decisions.
